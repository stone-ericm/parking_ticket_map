using the Open Parking and Camera Violations API https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/nc67-uf89.json
we will extract only the parking tickets and understand the location where they were issued
in order to create a heatmap for new york city parking tickets based on the day of the week
and the hour of the day. The heatmap should ideally be on the level of, for example,
41st street between 8th ave and 7th ave, if that's possible.
